# Credit Card Fraud Analysis

## Description
This project analyzes a credit card transactions dataset to identify patterns and anomalies that could indicate fraudulent activity. The project employs data cleaning, clustering using k-means, and linear regression techniques. Visualizations are created to provide insights into the data and the results of the analysis.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed missing values and outliers using IQR method.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Performed clustering on selected features and visualized the results.
- **Linear Regression**: Built a regression model to predict transaction amounts based on selected features.
- **Visualizations**: Included histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps, and elbow plots to explain findings.

## Visualizations
The following visualizations are included:
- **Histogram**: Distribution of transaction amounts.
- **Scatter Plot**: Visualizing clusters based on features.
- **Heatmap**: Correlation matrix for all features.
- **Elbow Plot**: Optimal number of clusters for k-means clustering.

## Results
- The dataset was successfully cleaned and prepared for analysis.
- Identified distinct clusters in the data using k-means.
- Built a regression model to predict transaction amounts with reasonable accuracy.
